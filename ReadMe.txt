How to use Project Requirements:
---------------------------
When the page opens you are able to do one of three things: Import, Add, and Remove.

Currently, Import does not work; however Add and Remove do.

You can add a new requirement by clicking "Add new requirement" which will open a modal to add a new requirement.

Make sure to input the following information for it to work, especially by selecting the type of requirement: functional or nonfunctional.

Currently, remove requirement only works in the functional requirements table.

If you enter 0, it will default to 1 which is the first element in the table which is not the table headers.
